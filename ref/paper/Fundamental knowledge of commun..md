## Background
**LTE**: Long-term evolution is a standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals, based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies.
**NR (New Radio)**: a new radio access technology (RAT) developed by 3GPP for the 5G (fifth generation) mobile network. It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks.
The reference signals are as follows.
+ Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS);
+ Phase Tracking Reference Signal (PTRS);
+ Sounding Reference Signal (SRS);
+ Channel State Information Reference Signal (CSI-RS).

**DMRS**: Demodulation reference signal, which is used in the PUSCH & PUCCH channels' coherent demodulation.
**PUSCH**: Physical Uplink Shared Channel.
